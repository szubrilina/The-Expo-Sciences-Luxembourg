# The-Expo-Sciences-Luxembourg
All materials that were prepared by me for conference (Luxembourg, 2017)

It was my school scientific project were I studied graph theory, Ramsey theory, NP-hard problems and in particular algorithms finding cliques and independent sets.

I was created the program that built (using API-requests) graph based on you social network account and divided all your friends into maximal cliques (using polynomial approximate algorithms of finding cliques).
